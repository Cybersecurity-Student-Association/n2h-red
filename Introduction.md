# Introduction to Penetration Testing Methodology

I will attempt to structure the labs so that we make use of the [Penetration Testing Execution
Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines).
I'm note expecting anyone to show up with this memorized or anything, but do
try to read at least the "Overview" from each of these sections.  The goal here
is to help develop some of the common terminology.

I will attempt to use 7 phases described in the PETS to frame each lab.  The
phases are

- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

Where applicable, some of these will be simulated.  For example, Pre-engagement
interactions are mostly targeted toward live, professional penetration tests,
where the hiring company and penetration testing company agree on the details
of the test before the engagement actually begins.  In cases like this, I will
try to supply questions to think about, which we can discuss in the "in-person"
sessions.
